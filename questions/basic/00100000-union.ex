|QUESTIONNAME|
Combining results from multiple queries
|QUESTION|
You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility names.  Yes, this is a contrived example :-).  Produce that list!
|QUERY|
select surname 
	from cd.members
union all
select name
	from cd.facilities;
|ANSWER|
<p>The <c>UNION</c> operator does what you might expect: combines the results of two SQL queries into a single table.  The caveat is that both results from the two queries must have the same number of columns and compatible data types.
<p><c>UNION</c> removes duplicate rows, while <c>UNION ALL</c> does not.  Use <c>UNION ALL</c> by default, unless you care about duplicate results.
|HINT|
Look up the SQL keyword <c>UNION</c>
