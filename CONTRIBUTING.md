# Contributing to pgexercises

First off, I appreciate any interest in contributing to pgexercises! Thanks in advance for your help. Without wishing to put you off, it's worth warning you that my life is pretty busy and the rate at which I review things is a bit on the glacial side. That being the case, if you're thinking about making a nontrivial contribution I would suggest emailing me in advance to check in, as I don't want to delay you/waste your time :-).

There's two different sides for contribution - the site code and the exercise content.

* Regarding the site code, most of it is HTML/CSS/Javascript, at which it is fairly obvious I am not an expert :-). I wholeheartedly appreciate any assistance here, particularly with making the CSS less icky, the site more usable on mobile devices, etc. The Java code could also use some cleanup/formalising/automated testing. This code has grown organically and while perfectly managable right now due to its small size, I'd like to keep things working reliably if the codebase grows in future.
* For the exercise content, I want to maintain a strong editorial voice: the site has been written with a clear progression and explanatory method in mind, and I don't want to disrupt that. Small edits are frequently accepted, but large contributions are likely to undergo some pretty heavy reviewing/editing. I'm really happy for any assistance here, but I also want to avoid disappointment by setting expectations that there may be a somewhat extended review cycle.
